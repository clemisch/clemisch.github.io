Hi! I am Clemens Schmid and a PhD candidate with Franz Pfeiffer at TUM. I am currently based in Munich, Germany.

Academically, I am interested in image processing, computational physics, medical imaging, and open-source software.

For my PhD research, I worked on integrating a Talbot-Lau interferometer into a clinical CT system to perform dark-field tomography on humans for the first time. My focus were the algorithmic processing of image data. Apart from this main project, I designed and maintained the core libraries of our chair (which sadly are not open-source).

I hope to do a Postdoc soon on new imaging methodology; merging physics, signal processing, and software engineering.
