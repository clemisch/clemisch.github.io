Hi! I am Clemens Schmid, a PhD candidate at the [Department of Physics at TUM](https://www.ph.nat.tum.de/en/e17/home/). I am currently based in Munich, Germany.

Academically, I am interested in image processing, computational physics, medical imaging, and open-source software.

For my PhD research, I worked on integrating a Talbot-Lau interferometer into a clinical CT system to perform X-ray dark-field tomography on humans. My focus were modeling and algorithmic processing of image data. Apart from this main project, I designed and maintained the core libraries of our chair (which sadly are not open-source).

I hope to do a Postdoc soon on new imaging methodology with X-rays at a synchrotron---merging physics, signal processing, and software engineering.
